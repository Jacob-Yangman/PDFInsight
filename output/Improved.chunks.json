    "### 摘要 (Abstract)\n\nLarge multimodal models (LMM) have recently shown encouraging progress with visual instruction tuning. In this paper, we present the first systematic study to investigate the design choices of LLMs in a controlled setting under the LLaVA framework. We show that the fully-connected vision-language connector in LLaVA is surprisingly powerful and data-efficient. With simple modifications to LLaVA, namely, using CLIP-ViT-L/336px with an MLP projection and adding academic-task-oriented VQA data with response formatting prompts, we establish stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art across 11 benchmarks. Our final 13B checkpoint uses merely 1.2M publicly available data, and finishes full training in ∼1 day on a single 8-A100 node. Furthermore, we present some early exploration of open problems in LLMs, including scaling to higher resolution inputs, compositional capabilities, and model hallucination, etc. We hope this makes state-of-the-art LLM research more accessible. Code and model will be publicly available.",
    "---\n\n### 1. 引言 (Introduction)",
    "Large multimodal models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in the research community, as they are the key building blocks towards general-purpose assistants [2, 30, 43]. Recent studies on LLMs are converging on a central concept known as visual instruction tuning [36]. The results are promising; e.g., LLaVA [36] and MiniGPT-4 [62] demonstrate impressive results on natural instruction-following and visual reasoning capabilities. To better understand the capability of LLMs, multiple benchmarks [17, 27, 34, 37, 55] have been proposed. Recent works further demonstrate improved performance by scaling up the pretraining data [3, 14, 54], instruction-following data [14, 18, 29, 58], visual encoders [3], or language models [39], respectively. The LLaVA architecture is also leveraged in different downstream tasks and domains, including region-level [8, 56] and pixel-level [26, 50] understanding, biomedical assistants [31], image generation [5], adversarial studies [6, 59].\n\n---",

    "### 正文继续\n\nHowever, despite many benchmarks and developments, it still remains unclear what the best recipe is to train LLMs towards the goal of general-purpose assistants. For example, LLaVA [36] excels in conversational-style visual reasoning and even outperforms later approaches like InstructBLIP [14] on such benchmarks [55], while InstructBLIP excels in traditional VQA benchmarks that demand single-word or short answers. Given the significant differences in the model architecture and training data between them, the root cause of the disparity in their capabilities remains elusive, despite conjectures [37, 55]: the amount of training data, the usage of resamplers like Qformer [32], etc. To this",

    "### 文档内容提取\n\n#### 标题\n**2. Related Work**",
    "#### 正文内容\n\n##### **Instruction-following large multimodal models (LLMs).**\n- **Common architectures**: Include a pre-trained visual backbone to encode visual features, a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to comprehend user instructions and produce responses, and a vision-language cross-modal connector to align the vision encoder outputs with the language models.\n- **As shown in Fig. 1**, LLava [36] is perhaps the simplest architecture for LLMs.\n- **Optional components**: Visual resamplers (e.g., Qformer [32]) are used to reduce the number of visual patches [3, 14, 62].\n- **Training protocol**: Usually follows a two-stage process:\n  1. **Vision-language alignment pretraining stage**: Leverages image-text pairs to align visual features with the language model's word embedding space.\n     - Earlier works utilize relatively few image-text pairs (e.g., ~600K [36] or ~6M [62]).\n     - Some recent works pretrain the vision-language connector on a large amount of image-text pairs (e.g., 129M [14] and 1.4B [3]), to maximize the LMM's performance.\n  2. **Visual instruction tuning stage**: Tunes the model on visual instructions [36], enabling it to follow users' diverse requests involving visual contents.\n- **Dealing with higher resolution**: Studies on grids in LMM are explored in concurrent works [1, 28, 53].",
    "##### **Multimodal instruction-following data**\n- **NLP studies**: Show that the quality of instruction-following data largely affects the capability of the resulting instruction-following models [61].\n- **For visual instruction tuning**, LLava [36] is the pioneer to leverage text-only GPT-4 to expand the existing COCO [35] bounding box and caption dataset to a multimodal instruction-following dataset containing three types of instruction-following data: conversational-style QA, detailed description, and complex reasoning.\n- **LLava's pipeline**: Has been employed to expand to textual understanding [57], million-scales [58], and region-level conversations [8].\n- **InstructBLIP [14]** incorporates academic-task-oriented VQA datasets to further enhance the model's visual capabilities.\n- **Conversely**, [7] identifies that such naive data merging can result in models that tend to overfit to VQA datasets and thus are unable to participate in natural conversations.\n- **Authors further propose**: To leverage the LLava pipeline to convert VQA datasets to a conversational style. While this proves effective for training, it introduces added complexities in data scaling.\n- **However, in NLP**, the FLAN family [13, 51] shows that adding a large number of academic language tasks for instruction tuning can effectively improve the generalization.\n\n#### 总结段落\n- **Systematic study on training of large multimodal models**: Introduces a simple yet effective approach to balance multitask learning and efficient scaling for large multimodal models.\n- **Improved baselines**: LLava-1.5 uses only public data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of 11 tasks, and is significantly more data-efficient than previous approaches.\n- **By rethinking conventional approaches and exploring open problems in visual instruction tuning**, the way is paved for more robust and capable systems for LLMs.\n- **Hope**: These improved and easily-reproducible baselines will provide a reference for future research in open-source LLMs.",

    "#### Title and Introduction\nThe document discusses the challenges faced by multimodal models in balancing between natural conversations and academic tasks, particularly focusing on visual reasoning capabilities. It highlights the need to investigate the root cause of this inability.\n\n---",
    "### 3. Approach\n\n#### 3.1. Preliminaries",
    "**LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Alignment)**\n- **Overview**: LLaVA [36] demonstrates commendable proficiency in visual reasoning capabilities, surpassing even more recent models on diverse benchmarks [4, 55] for real-life visual instruction-following tasks.\n- **Architecture**: Uses a single linear layer to project visual features to language space and optimizes the whole LLM for visual instruction tuning.\n- **Limitations**: Falls short on academic benchmarks that typically require short-form answers (e.g., single-word), tending to answer \"yes\" for yes/no questions due to the lack of such data in the training distribution.\n\n**InstructBLIP**\n- **Overview**: The pioneer in incorporating academic-task-oriented datasets like VQA-v2 [19] along with LLaVA-Instruct [36], demonstrating improved performance on VQA benchmarks.\n- **Training Process**: Pretrains Qformer [32] on 129M image-text pairs and only finetunes the instruction-aware Qformer for visual instruction tuning.\n- **Limitations**: Recent studies [7, 55] show it does not perform as well as LLaVA on engaging in real-life visual conversation tasks. Specifically, it can overfit to VQA training sets with short-answers, even on requests that require detailed responses.",
    "---\n\n#### 3.2. Response Format Prompting",
    "**Challenge Identified**\n- The inability to balance between short- and long-form VQA responses for approaches like InstructBLIP [14], which leverages instruction following data including both natural responses and short-answers, is mainly due to:\n  1. **Ambiguous Prompts on Response Format**: For example, `Q: [Question] A: [Answer]`. Such prompts do not clearly indicate the desired output format, leading to overfitting behavior towards short-form answers.\n  2. **Limited Finetuning of LLM**: InstructBLIP only finetunes the Qformer for instruction-tuning, requiring the Qformer’s visual output tokens to control the length of the LLM’s output. However, the Qformer may lack the capability to properly do so due to its limited capacity compared with LLMs like LLaMA.\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n- Use a single response formatting prompt that clearly indicates the output format. Append this prompt at the end of VQA questions when promoting short answers: `Answer the question using a single word or phrase`.\n- This approach enables LLaVA to properly adjust the output format according to the user's instructions without requiring additional processing of VQA answers using tools like ChatGPT [7].",
    "**Results**\n- As shown in Table 2, merely including VQA v2 [19] in training significantly improves LLaVA's performance on MME (1323.8 vs. 809.6) and outperforms InstructBLIP by 111 points.\n\n---",
    "#### 3.3. Scaling the Data and Model\n\n**MLP Vision-Language Connector**\n- Inspired by improved performance in self-supervised learning through changing from a linear projection to an MLP [9, 10], the document suggests improving the vision-language connector's representation power with a two-layer MLP to enhance multimodal capabilities compared to the original linear projection.",
    "**Academic Task-Oriented Data**\n- Additional academic-task-oriented VQA datasets for VQA, OCR, and region-level perception are included to enhance the model's capabilities in various ways, as shown in Table 2.\n\n---",
    "### Tables and Figures\n\n#### Table 1: Visual Input Example Illustrating Challenges",
    "**Visual Input Example, Multitask Balancing Problem**\n- **Image Description**: A person standing next to a yellow taxi.\n- **User Query**: Is this unusual? Please explain in detail.\n- **InstructBLIP Response**: Yes.\n\n**Visual Input Example, Different Format Prompts**\n- **Normal Prompt**: What is the color of the shirt that the man is wearing?\n  - **Response**: The man is wearing a yellow shirt.\n- **Ambiguous Prompt**: Q: What is the color of the shirt that the man is wearing? A:\n  - **Response**: The man is wearing a yellow shirt.\n- **Formatting Prompt**: What is the color of the shirt that the man is wearing? Answer the question using a single word or phrase.\n  - **Response**: Yellow.",
    "**Notes**: \n- The results are obtained zero-shot directly after LLaVA undergoes the first-stage vision-language alignment pretraining, without the second-stage visual instruction tuning.\n- The same image input is used across all examples.\n\n---",

VizWiz [20] contains 8,000 images to evaluate model's zero-shot generalization on visual questions asked by visually impaired people. Following InstructBLIP [14], the image subset of ScienceQA [38] with multiple choice is used to evaluate the zero-shot generalization on scientific question answering.

    "| User | If there are factual errors in the questions, point it out; if not, proceed to answering the question. What’s happening in the desert? |\n| --- | --- |\n| GPT-4V | Sorry, I cannot answer that question as there is no context about which desert you are referring to. |\n| LLaVA | In the image, there is a city skyline with buildings and a beach with people enjoying the sunset. The scene is set in a desert, which is unusual for a beach setting. |\n| LLaVA-1.5 | There are no deserts in the image. The image features a beach with palm trees, a city skyline, and a large body of water. |\n\n**Explanation:** This table demonstrates how LLaVA-1.5 can detect and address tricky or misleading questions by analyzing the visual content provided. Unlike GPT-4V, which cannot answer due to missing context, LLaVA-1.5 identifies the inconsistency between the question (desert) and the actual image content (beach with palm trees and a city skyline).",
    "---\n\n#### Section 4.2: Results",
    "**We show that LLaVA-1.5 achieves the best overall performance on 12 benchmarks, despite using magnitudes smaller pretraining and instruction tuning data compared with other methods [3, 14]. LLaVA-1.5 significantly outperforms LLaVA on all benchmarks for instruction-following LLMs. Note that it is challenging to evaluate the original LLaVA on academic datasets like VQA-v2 [19] that demand open-ended short answers.**\n\nWhen scaling up the image resolution to 448² with LLaVA-1.5-HD, the overall performance improves across all benchmarks, particularly on tasks requiring perception of details in images (e.g., OCR in MM-Vet). Adding global context effectively recovers the model from split-and-merge artifacts and guides it to locate relevant regions more easily.",
    "**It is encouraging that LLaVA-1.5 achieves the best performance with the simplest architecture, academic compute and public datasets, and yields a fully-reproducible and affordable baseline for future research.** The results suggest that visual instruction tuning plays an important role in improving an LMM's capabilities and raises questions about the common belief that LMMs require significant amounts of vision-language alignment pretraining [3, 14, 32], despite vision encoders (e.g., CLIP [44], OpenCLIP [23], EVA-CLIP [16]) already being pretrained on web-scale image-text paired data.\n\nLLaVA-1.5 (even the 7B model) outperforms 80B IDEFICS [22], a Flamingo-like LLM with billions of trainable parameters for cross-modal connection. This makes us rethink the benefits of vision samplers and the necessity of additional large-scale pretraining in terms of multimodal instruction-following capabilities.",

    "#### Main Text\n\n**Introduction to Model Behavior**\n- The model is designed to output \"Unanswerable\" when the provided content is insufficient to answer the question, and the response format prompt effectively instructs the model to do so (11.1% → 67.8% on unanswerable questions).\n- Qualitative examples are presented to verify tricky questions (Fig. 5), constrained JSON format responses (Fig. 6), and more in the appendix.",
    "**Multilingual Multimodal Capability**\n- Though LLava-1.5 is not finetuned for multilingual multimodal instruction (all visual instructions including VQA are in English), it is capable of following multilingual instructions.\n- This capability is partly due to the multilingual language instructions in ShareGPT.\n- Despite ShareGPT not containing images in its instructions, the model learns from this dataset to adaptively respond with the language corresponding to the user's request.\n- Empirical evidence shows that this behavior transfers to visual conversations.\n- Quantitatively, the model's generalization capability to Chinese is evaluated on MMbench-CN [37], where questions of MMbench are converted to Chinese.\n- Notably, LLava-1.5 outperforms Qwen-VL-Chat by +7.3% (63.6% vs 56.7%), despite Qwen being finetuned on Chinese multimodal instructions while LLava-1.5 is not.\n\n#### Section 4.4: Ablation on LLM Choices\n- Findings suggest that the capability of the base LLM can affect its instruction-tuned successors.\n- Two families of LLMs are explored to study their contribution to the final model's multimodal capability:\n  - LLAMA-based (Vicuna-v1.1, Vicuna-v1.3)\n  - LLAMA-2-based (Vicuna-v1.5, LLAMA-2-Chat)\n- Vicuna-v1.3 and Vicuna-v1.5 use the same ~150K ShareGPT data (2× that used in v1.1).\n- Unlike Vicuna series that is only trained with supervised instruction finetuning (SFT), LLAMA-2-Chat is further optimized with reinforcement-learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n- Relative performance of these variants is visualized in Fig. 3.",
    "**Key Observations from Fig. 3:**\n1. **Overall Performance**: Vicuna-v1.5 achieves the best overall performance, and LLAMA-2-based models generally perform better than LLAMA-1-based models, highlighting the importance of the base language model.\n2. **Generalization to MMbench-CN**: Despite Vicuna-v1.3 and v1.5 using the same ShareGPT data for instruction tuning, the generalization to Chinese of Vicuna-v1.3 is significantly worse than v1.5.\n3. **Language Instruction-Tuning Impact**: Language instruction-tuning matters on specific capabilities required by each dataset. For example:\n   - Although LLAMA-2-Chat and Vicuna-v1.5 achieve almost the same performance on MMbench, the generalization to MMbench-CN of LLAMA-2-Chat is worse than Vicuna-v1.5.\n   - This is partly due to the most SFT/RLHF data of LLAMA-2-Chat being in English and not containing as many multilingual data as in ShareGPT.\n   - TextVQA requires both the model's capability of identifying text characters in images and processing noisy OCR outputs; such noise may be more commonly observed in the ShareGPT data, which is collected in-the-wild from daily usage of ChatGPT.\n\n#### Section 5: Open Problems in LMMs\n- Given the successful scaling of LLava-1.5, additional studies are conducted on open problems in LLMs using the model design and data mixture of LLava-1.5.",

    "#### Section 5.1: Data Efficiency\nDespite the data efficiency of LLaVA-1.5 when compared with approaches like InstructBLIP [14], the training of LLaVA-1.5 still doubles when compared with LLaVA. In this section, we conduct experiments for further improving the data efficiency by randomly sub-sampling the training data mixture of LLaVA-1.5, with a sampling ratio ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. We visualize the relative performance of different sampling variants in Fig. 4.\n\nFirst, the full data mixture provides the best knowledge coverage and allows the model to achieve the best overall performance. To our surprise, with only 50% of the samples, the model still maintains more than 98% of the full dataset performance. This suggests that there is room for further improvements in data efficiency.",
    "Second, when downsampling the dataset to 50%, the model's performance on MMBench, ScienceQA, and POPE does not decrease at all, and it even slightly improves on MMBench. Similarly, the model's performance remains steady when further downsampling the data from 50% to 30%. These results show promise of having the less-is-more [61] benefit for multimodal models as well.\n\n---",
    "#### Section 5.2: Rethinking Hallucination in LMMs\nHallucination is an important issue to tackle for LLMs and LMMs. Often in LMMs, we attribute the model's hallucination to the errors or hallucinations in the training dataset. For example, the detailed descriptions in LLaVA-Instruct [36] may contain a small amount of hallucinated content, and it is believed that training on such data *may* have caused the model to hallucinate when asked to \"describe the image in detail\". However, we find that such hallucination is significantly reduced when we scale the model's inputs to higher resolutions such as 448².\n\nThis finding is interesting as it suggests that the LMMs may be robust to *a few* such errors in the training data. However, when the input resolution is not sufficient for the model to discern all details in the training data, and the amount of data that is at that granularity beyond the model's capability becomes large enough, the model *learns* to hallucinate. This further suggests that there needs to be a balance between improving the data annotation with more details and the model's capability to properly process the information at such granularities. We hope this finding provides a reference for future work in terms of dealing with hallucination and the scaling of the models and data.",
    "---\n\n#### Section 5.3: Compositional Capabilities\nWe demonstrate interesting compositional capabilities in LLaVA-1.5: the model trained on a set of tasks independently generalizes to tasks that require a combination of these capabilities without explicit joint training. We note some of the findings below.",
    "---\n\n#### Section 6: Conclusion\nIn this paper, we take a step towards demystifying the design of large multimodal models and propose a simple, effective, and data-efficient baseline, LLaVA-1.5, for large multimodal models. In addition, we explore the open problems in visual instruction tuning, scale LMMs to higher resolutions, and present some intriguing findings in terms of model hallucination and compositional capabilities for LMMs. We hope these improved and easily-reproducible baselines as well as the new findings will provide a reference for future research in open-source LMM.",

    "---\n\n#### **A. Implementation Details**",
    "##### **A.1. LLaVA-1.5-HD**\n\n###### **A.1.1 Preprocessing**",
    "**Overview.** We use CLIP-ViT-L-14 (224²) as the base image encoder. We first select and pad the input image to a target resolution that effectively captures its details, and split the image into 224² grids. All 224² image patches are encoded by the CLIP image encoder separately, and their features are merged back to a single large feature map. We then post-process the resulting feature map to a flattened list of features. We additionally concatenate the features of a fixed-resolution image to provide the model with a global context.\n\n**Target resolution selection.** We predefine a set of resolutions to support up to six grids (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x5, 1x6, 2x2, 2x3, and their transpose). This system allows for a maximum resolution of 672x448 (or 448x672). Two criteria are enforced in the target resolution selection:\n1. **Detail preservation:** The selected resolution preserves as much detail from the original image as possible.\n2. **Resource efficiency:** The resolution should not be excessively large to avoid unnecessary consumption of pixels and memory (e.g., it should not select 448² for a 224² input image).",
    "**Postprocessing.** We perform three steps of postprocessing to ensure that the final features can be processed effectively and efficiently by the language model:\n1. **Padding removal.** Features corresponding exclusively to the paddings are discarded. This reduces the number of visual tokens processed by the language model and improves the efficiency.\n2. **Row-end Tokens.** We append a special token to the end of each row of features, to provide an explicit indication of the shape of the image. Unlike the original LLaVA and LLaVA-1.5 that uses a fixed resolution, we now use a variable resolution for the image features of LLaVA-1.5-HD. Such indication allows the language model to capture the exact shape and the size of the image for each sample.\n3. **Flattening.** Finally, we flatten the image feature map and feed it into the language model along with language tokens.\n\n###### **A.1.2 Training**",
    "Since we compute the visual features on the original 224² resolution that the vision encoder is trained on, we do not perform additional pretraining. We also do not perform additional high-resolution pretraining for the visual projectors and perform visual instruction tuning directly on the higher-resolution images.\n\n##### **A.2 Data**",
    "Our final training data mixture contains a variety of datasets: VQA [19, 21, 41, 45], OCR [42, 47], region-level VQA [24, 25, 40], visual conversation [36], and language conversation [46] data. We adopt multiple strategies to reduce training cost and enhance efficiency, detailed as follows:\n\n1. For VQA datasets, QA pairs from the same training image are merged into a single conversation.\n2. For ShareGPT [46], we filter out invalid conversations as [12]. Unlike Vicuna [12], long conversations that surpass 2048 tokens are truncated rather than splitting into multiple conversations. This results in ~40K conversations.\n3. Each QA pair in A-OKVQA [45] is augmented \\( k \\) times, where \\( k \\) is the number of choices per question, to counterbalance the lack of multiple-choice data.\n4. 80K conversations are sampled from OCRVQA [42].",

    "### C. Limitations\n\nDespite the promising results demonstrated by LLaVA-1.5, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, LLaVA-1.5 utilizes full image patches, potentially prolonging each training iteration. While visual resamplers [3, 14, 32] reduce the number of visual patches in LLMs, they currently cannot achieve convergence as efficiently as LLaVA with a comparable amount of training data, probably due to more trainable parameters in the resamplers. The development of a sample-efficient visual resampler could pave the way for future scaling-up of instruction-following multimodal models. Second, LLaVA-1.5 is not yet capable of processing multiple images due to the lack of such instruction-following data, and the limit of the context length. Third, although LLaVA-1.5 exhibits proficiency in following complex instructions, its problem-solving capabilities can still be limited in certain domains, which could be improved with a more capable language model and with high-quality, targeted visual instruction tuning data. Finally, despite its significantly reduced propensity for hallucination, LLaVA-1.5 is not exempt from producing hallucinations and occasionally disseminating misinformation, and should be used with caution in critical applications (e.g., medical).",
